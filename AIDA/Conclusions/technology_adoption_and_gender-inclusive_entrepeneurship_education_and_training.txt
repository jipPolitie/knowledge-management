From a theoretical perspective, the findings provide further evidence that adopting ICT
resources is a gendered process. The findings also provide insights to enhance the
capabilities of business owners, and implications with respect to increasing ICT resources.
Specifically, the study has documented strategies to support the adoption of digital
technologies within gender-inclusive ICT programs. Based on 21 key informant interviews (22 interviewees), respondents from different backgrounds and expertise concerning digital
technology, business ownership, and women’s enterprise advanced recommendations to
inform EETs as means of mitigating the digital divide. Recommendations to inform
curricula were reported. Foundational digital skills and competencies were identified,
including the ability to develop a “technology plan”that aligns with the owner’s
expectations and business plan, and the ability to lever software capabilities in financial
analysis and reporting. Finally, gender implications for ICT programming in facilitating
access to resources, and within program design, development and delivery in the digital
economy were identified.
