the influence of employees'

this paperhas developed and tested a model of
coworkers on their it usage, based on concepts from sip theory [19, 20, 66], and
grounded in prior qualitative field studies of it use among clerical employees [86,
87] and knowledge workers [23, 73]. our resuits provide support for what we label
the complianceeffect, but not the internalizationeffect of sip, since our findings
confirmed a relationship between coworkers' level of it use and their beliefs about
trainingquality(h6 and h4, respectively),andtheindirecteffectof coworkers'level
of computerself-efficacy(h5).takenas a whole,we believethat thesefindings pro-
