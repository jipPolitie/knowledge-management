conclusions
about the effectiveness of online versus offline learning.

further research

despite some outstanding questions, the findings of
this review offer supporting evidence on the effective-
ness of online learning in undergraduate medical
education. further research is needed to clarify the
effects of online learning and the conditions under
which it can be effectively used. whether online
learning works as a direct or mediated factor in
improving achievement needs to be assessed, as do
what design and delivery strategies for online learn-
ing works in practice. how the advantages of online
learning can be used to amplify other teaching meth-
ods for undergraduate medical students also needs to
be studied. the design of the assessment instruments
and curriculum types used for online learning
requires further study. it is possible that students do
acquire knowledge and skills through online learning
that cannot obtain through offline learning, and this
knowledge could compensate for the loss of knowl-
edge and skills identified by questionnaires for offline
learning.

conclusion

although not all of the included research studies
reported that using online learning methods in med-
ical education was more effective than offline learn-
ing, none of the included studies concluded that
online learning was less effective than offline meth-
ods, regardless of the statistical method used. we
need to recognize that online learning has its own
advantages for enhancing students’
learning and
should be considered a potential teaching method in
medical education. to guarantee the effectiveness of
online learning, the design principles of digital learn-
ing materials, learning goals and students’ preferences
and characteristics should be rigorously evaluated.
