conclusions

the political and economic environment plays a vital role in en-
trepreneurship development. for entrepreneurship to assume the stra-
tegic economic role, actions must be exerted. decision-makers, both in
regional or national levels, must move from mere subjective intentions
policies for the promotion of entrepreneurship to an unyielding com-
mitment to entrepreneurship development by drawing accurate and
ecological policies, actions and avoid those that might intimidate po-
tential entrepreneurs. in this context, this research on digital learning
methodologies to develop entrepreneurial capacity on the he students
assumes a position of critical strategic importance.

the enrichment of this paper is to ﬁll up some of the lack of un-
derstanding about e-education methodologies, which promote the de-
velopment of knowledge and skills that will beneﬁt potential en-
trepreneurs. moreover, our focus was on higher education students and
young entrepreneurs.

in summary, the results of the present research show that the use of
digital methodologies is increasing in education, as we can see in all the
study's made in the last three years and that these technologies can
enhance the students learning the process with innovations such as
mobile technologies, tablets, and smartphones applications.

as the leading methodologies, tools, systems and contexts in e-
education, our ﬁndings denote out for a need to increase the mix of
those methodologies in education with the goal to prepare students to
think critically and solve complex problems, work collaboratively,
communicate eﬃciently and have more autonomy an independence in
the learning process and become autonomous and independents, giving
them tools to create their own business or to be intrapreneurs in their
professional life's.

emerging from the results of the questionnaire it's possible to say
that there are few diﬀerences between the methods and methodologies
that can be used to promote the entrepreneurial activity, according to
the two groups under study, despite the diﬀerent degrees (orders) of
importance. in this question, the similarities between the groups are
given to the level of networking opportunities, education, business
counselling, economic/financial
facilities, subsistence allowance,
family support and co-operative education.

more speciﬁcally for the development of the entrepreneurial capa-
city, we propose a model that combines the stages of the start-up pro-
cess with the e-education methodologies which emerged from the lit-
erature review, and the methodologies identiﬁed by the he students

and the young entrepreneurs.

the analysis of the data from the questionnaire allows us to con-
clude that regarding the most critical stages of the business creation
process, the diﬀerences only occur in the importance of market and
product analysis: in the group of entrepreneurs it appears in second
place, and the group of he students appears in ﬁfth place.

for the business plan creation, the e-education methodologies more
adequate are project based-learning; problem based-learning; digital
stories; online learning environments; technology integrated teaching
methods; digital storytelling; educational games; active learning; and
the students and the entrepreneurs identiﬁed: mentoring, business
counselling, self-directed experienced learning, and education.

for the choice and structuring of the idea for the enterprise the e-
education methodologies more
collaborative
communities; cooperative learning; collaborative learning; network
participation; and the students and the entrepreneurs identiﬁed:
networking opportunities and examples of success.

adequate

are:

regarding the pilot project of the entrepreneurial idea, the e-edu-
cation methodologies more adequate are: augmented reality; web-
based video; gamiﬁcation; simulation; and the students and the en-
trepreneurs identiﬁed: incubation/oﬃce facilities, subsistence allow-
ance, seed capital, and social media & advertisement.

in respect to market and product analysis, the e-education meth-
odologies more adequate are: web-based video; narrated stop-motion
animation; generic modelling language; digital video; augmented
reality; gamiﬁcation; simulation; webinars; and the students and the
entrepreneurs identiﬁed: example of success, training, social media &
advertisement.

for achieving sustainability of entrepreneurial idea, the e-education
methodologies more adequate are: collaborative communities;
cooperative learning; collaborative learning; network participation;
and the students and the entrepreneurs
identiﬁed: education;
economic/financial facilities, and family support.

finally, for evaluation of entrepreneurial skills and characteristics,
the e-education methodologies more adequate are: flipped classroom
using digital media; cooperative learning; collaborative learning;
moving from ﬁxing to online space; experiential online development;
open educational practice; online learning environments; technology
integrated teaching methods; digital storytelling; educational games;
active learning; and the students and the entrepreneurs identiﬁed:
follow-up support, co-operative education.
